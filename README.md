## Future Enhancements (Ideas for later!)

* Add more unit categories (e.g., weight, volume, speed).
* Implement more robust input validation (e.g., ensure numerical input).
* Allow batch conversions or conversions from a file.
✓ Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
* Add a feature to list all supported units.
